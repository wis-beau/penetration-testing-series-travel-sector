A reusable checklist to guide pentest engagements.  
Adapt based on scope, client requirements, and methodology.

---

## 1. Pre-Engagement & Scoping
- [ ] Define objectives
- [ ] Confirm scope (domains, IPs, systems)
- [ ] Sign authorization forms
- [ ] Agree on testing window and communication plan
- [ ] Establish rules of engagement

---

## 2. Reconnaissance & Scanning
- [ ] Passive recon (whois, DNS, OSINT)
- [ ] Active recon (port scans, service fingerprinting)
- [ ] Identify potential entry points
- [ ] Document findings

---

## 3. Threat Modeling
- [ ] Identify high-value assets
- [ ] Map potential attack paths
- [ ] Prioritize testing targets based on impact

---

## 4. Vulnerability Identification
- [ ] Test for injection flaws
- [ ] Check authentication and session management
- [ ] Review access controls
- [ ] Identify misconfigurations
- [ ] Capture verbose error messages

---

## 5. Exploitation
- [ ] Attempt exploitation of confirmed vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document payloads and execution steps
- [ ] Record evidence (screenshots, logs)

---

## 6. Post-Exploitation
- [ ] Verify data access and impact
- [ ] Test for privilege escalation
- [ ] Attempt persistence (with client consent)
- [ ] Remove all artifacts after testing

---

## 7. Reporting
- [ ] Draft technical findings
- [ ] Summarize risks for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] Provide remediation steps
