# Lessons Learned â€“ Internal Debrief

## 1. Importance of Pre-Test Briefing

- Everyone on the test team, even interns, must receive detailed RoE

## 2. Tighten Environment Segregation

- Clearly mark test vs production environments  
- Block unintended access via firewall rules

## 3. Incident Simulation Protocol

- Conduct tabletop exercises before test week  
- Helps spot risky misunderstandings ahead of time
