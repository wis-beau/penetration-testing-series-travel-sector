# Testing Types in Penetration Testing – Travel Sector Case

## 🧪 Overview

This folder explores the three primary types of penetration testing: Black Box, Gray Box, and White Box — using a case study of a travel agency’s customer login portal.

## 🔍 Case Summary

- **Black Box:** Tester knows nothing. Simulates external hacker.
- **Gray Box:** Tester has partial knowledge (e.g., credentials).
- **White Box:** Tester has full access to code, logic, or system architecture.

Each approach uncovered unique vulnerabilities:
- Hidden endpoints (Black Box)
- Authorization flaws (Gray Box)
- Logic errors (White Box)
