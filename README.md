# 🛡️ Penetration Testing Series – Travel & Tourism Sector

This repository documents a simulated penetration testing series focused on a fictional travel planning web application: **TripPlanner**. The goal is to demonstrate core concepts of penetration testing through light case studies, practical tooling examples, and reporting artifacts — all aligned with professional methodologies.

## 🗺️ Scenario

**Target**: A web-based platform used for booking tours, hotels, and transportation across Europe.  
**Sector**: Travel & Tourism  
**Purpose**: Help the CTO assess vulnerabilities across user login, booking APIs, and admin dashboards.
